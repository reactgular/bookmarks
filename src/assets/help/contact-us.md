## Got a Question or Problem?

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help me by submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/reactgular/bookmarks).
Even better, you can submit a pull request with a fix!

## Missing a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/reactgular/bookmarks). 
If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that 
everyone can use it. Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a major feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. 
This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help 
you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- Small features can be crafted and directly submitted as a pull request.
