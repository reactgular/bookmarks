# Getting Started

You can return to this documentation by clicking the "Help" option on the sidebar.

## The quick start guide

To jump right into using the app, do the following:

- click the "Create Document" option on the side bar.
- select one of the pre-made templates from the collection.
- a new document will be created and shown on the page.
- click the title at the top of the page, and rename your document.
- click the "Add Bookmarks" button on the side bar.
- enter the URL of a new bookmark, and press the "Enter" key to close the editor.

You're done! The app should be easy enough for you to use with little guidance. You can open the card editor to edit bookmarks, and drag/drop cards to
re-arrange them on the page. You can also drag/drop bookmarks between cards by dragging from the editor to another card. Documents on the sidebar can
also be re-arrange by drag/drop to arrange their order.
