# Creating your first document

To help you get started this app comes with some templates for new documents. You can select a template by clicking the "Create Document" option
from the side bar. You'll be presented with a collection of pre-made templates, but if you want to start with an empty document click the "A Blank Document" option
at the top of the page.

## Manage your documents

All your documents are shown on the sidebar as a list, and you can drag/drop documents to rearrange their order. Each document
has a menu that allows you to move them up or down, archive a document or delete a document.

Archiving removes a document from the sidebar, and moves it to the "Archived" sidebar. You can unarchive a document at anytime.

Deleting a document can not be undone at this time. So it's recommended to archive documents unless your sure you won't need it anymore.

## Rename a document

To rename a document, select the document on the sidebar to show it in the main page and click on the document title shown on the top bar.
The title will change to an input box allowing you to edit the title, and then press "Enter" to save your changes.

## Rearrange cards by dragging them

Documents display a collection of cards, and each card contains a list of bookmarks. You can rearrange the cards on the page by dragging and dropping them.

## Select multiple cards and make bulk changes

Each card on the page has a check mark in the upper left corner. Clicking a check mark activates multiple selection, and you can select one or move
cards. When multiple cards are selected a bulk editing sidebar is shown. This sidebar allows you to perform actions on all selected cards, such as changing
their color or deleting cards.

You can clear the current selection by pressing "Esc" on the keyboard, or clicking on the background of a document to unselect all cards.

You can also select all cards by pressing "CTRL+A" on the keyboard.
