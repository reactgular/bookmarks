# What is a Card?

Cards are colored rectangles shown on the page when you select a document. Each card contains a list of bookmarks
that you can click to open in the web browser. A card is a small element used to organize a small list of bookmarks, 
and each card can have a title and different background color.

Cards are interactive elements on the page. They can be drag/drop to rearrange their order, and you can open the
card editor by clicking in the white space inside the card.

## Creating your first card

To create a new card, select a document and click the "Add Bookmarks" button on the sidebar. This will open the
card creation dialog, and to create your first card it has to have at least one bookmark.

To create a new bookmark, you can type or paste a URL into the URL input and press "Enter" to trigger the fetching
of meta data for the URL. A bookmark does not require a title, but this app will try to discover the page title by
reading the HTML. If this is successful the title input will be updated with the page title, otherwise you will be
prompted to enter your own titles.

> Note: There is no "Save" button for editing bookmarks. So you have to press the "Enter" key to save your changes.

## Opening the card editor

To add or remove bookmarks to a card you have to open the card editor. This can be done by clicking on the white
space inside the card, or by clicking the "+" icon on the card's bottom tool bar. 

Bookmarks are organized as a list of editable elements. When you click a bookmark the editor for that bookmark is
opened. You can make changes to the title and URL for a bookmark, and save your changes by pressing "Enter".

## Updating bookmark titles and URLs

A bookmark is basically just a URL with a title. This app will display the favorite icon next to the bookmark title
to help identify bookmarks, but this only works if the HTML can be read by the server.

You can open the bookmark editor by clicking a bookmark inside the card editor. The bookmark will expand to display
input fields for editing the bookmark. There is a cloud icon to the right of the title that tells the server to
read the HTML from the URL, and update the bookmark title and favorite icon.

## Drag a bookmark to rearrange inside a card

Bookmarks shown inside the card editor can be rearranged by dragging the grip shown to the left of the bookmark
title. Click and drag the grip to move the bookmark to a new position.

## Drag a bookmark to another card

You can drag a bookmark from one card to another card. To move a bookmark to another card do the following:

- open the card editor for the card that contains the bookmark you want to move.
- if the bookmark is opened, then close by clicking the "X" icon to the top right of the bookmark editor.
- grab the drag handle on the left side of the bookmark.
- drag the bookmark outside of the card editor until the card editor collapses.
- drag the bookmark over top of another card, and hold until the card editor opens.
- drop the bookmark into the card editor.
